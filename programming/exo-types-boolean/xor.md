# XOR

> XOR gate (sometimes EOR, or EXOR and pronounced as Exclusive OR) is a digital logic gate that gives a true (1 or HIGH) output when the number of true inputs is odd. An XOR gate implements an exclusive or; that is, a true output results if one, and only one, of the inputs to the gate is true. If both inputs are false (0/LOW) or both are true, a false output results. XOR represents the inequality function, i.e., the output is true if the inputs are not alike otherwise the output is false. A way to remember XOR is "must have one or the other but not both"

| Input A | Input B | Output |
| ------- | :-----: | -----: |
| false   |  false  |  false |
| false   |  true   |   true |
| true    |  false  |   true |
| true    |  true   |  false |
